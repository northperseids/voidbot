# voidbot

Public files for the Void discord bot.

Void is a small self-care and venting bot.

Current features are: a grounding exercise, breathing exercise, digital bubble wrap, a list of over 50 self-care tasks, and two "yell/say something into the void" functions where you can tell the bot something in order to let it go.

Added 6/18/24: The bot also has a "check-in" command that runs through a guided self-check-in.

Void doesn't save any messages and all usage is "ephemeral," meaning Discord users cannot see bot usage of other users.

The bot's invite link is here: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1117526535243563238

If you'd like to test the bot first, please join the support server below. The bot is in the support server and you can test out each of the functions.

Thank you!
