# voidbot

Public files for the Void discord bot.

Void is a small self-care/venting discord bot. Users can tell it something,
and it will not save the message beyond the message's dismissal (using
discord's ephemeral message option).

The support server for this bot is at https://discord.gg/ZAdZEmM6DW.

Thank you!
